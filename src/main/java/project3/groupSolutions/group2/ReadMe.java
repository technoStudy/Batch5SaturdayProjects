/*
- Just create the method, i.e. no need to create the main method
- The method does not have to be static
- Do not print the returning value
- Since you do not create a main method, use the Tests class to check your answers
- Do not change the name of the method. Use the given name. (This is important for the test.)
- Order of the parameters should be as instructed. Do not mix the order of the method parameters. (This is important for the test.)

For testing
- Do not forget to import necessary junit libraries if IntelliJ have not done automatically
- Uncomment the relative tests after you created the methods.
  If you uncomment before you create the methods IntelliJ will complain about the method names.
  If compiler still complains about the method names, double check for your method name spellings (Remember Java is cAse sENsiTivE)

Good Luck!
